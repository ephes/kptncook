The error appears to happen before the Mealie upload. Our parser expects LocalizedString objects, but the KptnCook API response seems to now return plain strings for fields like authorComment and steps.*.title, and ingredients are missing localizedTitle (perhaps renamed to title/uncountableTitle). That makes Recipe.model_validate fail, so nothing gets sent to Mealie.\n\nIf you can, please share a small snippet from the saved JSON in ~/.kptncook/kptncook.json for the failing recipe (or the output of `kptncook search-by-id ...`) so we can confirm the new schema.
